Hand Gesture Glove 

An augmented glove is a type of wearable device that is designed to enhance the capabilities of the human hand. This type of glove is typically equipped with sensors and other technologies that can track and record the movement of the hand and fingers, as well as provide feedback to the wearer. The data collected by the sensors can be used to control digital devices or to provide input for virtual reality or gaming applications. Augmented gloves can also be equipped with actuators that can provide haptic feedback, or with other types of devices that can enhance the wearerâ€™s ability to interact with their environment, such as force sensors that can detect the force exerted by the hand on an object. Augmented gloves are used in many areas such as Education, Medical, Virtual and Augmented Reality, Gaming, Manufacturing. They are currently being researched and developed to improve the dexterity and control of robotic prosthetic hands, and to augment the capabilities of human operators in fields such as manufacturing and assembly.
